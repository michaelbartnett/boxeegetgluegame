Boxee/GetGlue Game
------------------

##TODO List

* Collision with Bullets and TextEnemies

* Scoring System

* Music

* SFX

* Play back EnemyManager.sendOneOff() in sequence

##Here's the plan:

1. Player runs App

2. App prompts user to log in to GetGlue

3. Javascript will query GetGlue to get recently viewed/favorite TV shows and movies.

4. Javascript will provide a function for the Flash Game to call to get a list of names of these.

5.  Flash Game will use this data to generate "TextEnemy" objects for the player to shoot at.

6. ???

7. Profit.
